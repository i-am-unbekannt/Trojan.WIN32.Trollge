Greetz everybody,

Malware is something no one likes but some people like test other malware so i decided to create one.
It's called "Trollge Incident". and i give you some infos what happen if you run it (please do not run this on a real computer)
There are 4 payloads that go through automatically.

Payload 1:
  gets executed after the first run, it change some regs and more like disable cmd, task manager, rename the user, add users and more
  if everything was successful, the computer will be restarted
  
Payload 2:
  Create many random file and after some time the computer get a [BSOD](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluescreen_(Windows))
  
Payload 3:
  Is a screen effect and also after some time the maschine get a [BSOD](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluescreen_(Windows))
  
Payload 4:
  This is the final payload. I don't want to say too much but what i can say is that a typing notepad opens and you should enjoy the last minute. 
  because you get some screen effect and a [BSOD](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluescreen_(Windows)) after that the [MBR](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_Boot_Record) is overridden with a custom message and your machine is unbootable
  
That is all. if you find some errors or something else send me a message on instagram [@i_am_unbekannt](https://instagram.com/i_am_unbekannt)
