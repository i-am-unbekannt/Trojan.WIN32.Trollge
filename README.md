Greetz everybody,

Malware is something no one likes but some people like to test malware so i decided to create one.
It's called "Trollge Incident". and i give you some infos what happen if you test it. There are 4 payloads that go through automatically.
If you want to skip a payload, just wait until a payload has started and restart your machine.

works on: Windows 10

Payload 1:
changes registrys disable cmd, task manager, regedit, rename user and add users...
if everything was successful, the machine will be restarted


Payload 2:
Create random files and after some time the machine gets a [BSOD](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluescreen_(Windows))


Payload 3:
screen effect and after some time the machine gets a [BSOD](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluescreen_(Windows))


Payload 4:
typing notepad, screen effect and a [BSOD](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluescreen_(Windows)) after that the [MBR](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_Boot_Record) is 
overridden with a custom message and your machine is unbootable.
 
If you find some errors or you have some ideas to add just message me on instagram [@i_am_unbekannt](https://instagram.com/i_am_unbekannt) or on [Discord](https://dsc.gg/unbekannt-community)
